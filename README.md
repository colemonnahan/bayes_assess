# Overcoming long run times in Bayesian stock assessments

This repository contains R code and model files to reproduce the analysis for the paper:

Monnahan, CC, TA Branch, JT Thorson, IJ Stewart, and CS Szuwalski (in review). Overcoming long run times in Bayesian stock assessments. In review at ICES Journal of Marine Science.

The analysis can be recreated by running the R script "run_analysis.R" after cloning this repo and installing the necessary R packages. We do not provide 
the model ADMB template files (.tpl) because they are proprietary. However, all the input files are included and the executables are available upon request for those interested in producing the analysis. 
The folder 'plots' contains extra figures not found in the publication or supplementary material.
